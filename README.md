# Yambda-5B-Analysis-Mining

## Project Title: Scalable Music Recommendation Analysis
**Dataset:** Yambda-5B (Music Interaction Logs)

### Project Overview
This project explores large-scale data mining techniques using a dataset of 5 billion music interactions. The goal is to compare traditional course-based methods (Frequent Itemset Mining) with advanced graph-based techniques (LightGNN).

### Current Progress: Checkpoint 1
- **Dataset Selection:** Justified the use of Yambda-5B over Time Series and Social Graph alternatives.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Analyzed track popularity (Long Tail) and temporal "burstiness" of listening sessions.
- **Integrity Testing:** Implemented automated checks for temporal causality and data diversity.

### Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, PyArrow (Parquet engine)
- **Environment:** Google Colab / VS Code
